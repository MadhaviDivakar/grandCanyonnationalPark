        description: "Grand Canyon East is located in the area along the Colorado River to the north and east of the South Rim. This is the most difficult area of the Grand Canyon to access, but intrepid adventurers are rewarded with smaller crowds and close-up views of the Grand Canyon. The primary physical attribute of the Grand Canyon East region is the Little Colorado River (LCR). The LCR is responsible for carving several of the smaller canyons in the region, and its lower 40 miles constitute one of the largest arms of the Grand Canyon. The Canyon surrounding the Little Colorado River is over 3,000 feet deep where it joins the Colorado River near Desert View between the South Rim and Grand Canyon East. Because of the mineral content in the Grand Canyon East area, the LCR flows with beautiful blue water in the summer months; in other parts of the year, it runs almost blood red."
