There are many attractions that make it worth a visit, including a number of locally-provided tours, visits to the smaller canyons, boat tours, helicopter tours, fishing, and rafting. Grand Canyon East is not easily accessible by bus from Las Vegas. The quickest way to reach the East Rim is by airplane.",
