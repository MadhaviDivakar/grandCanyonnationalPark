        text: "Because of its 8,000 ft/ 2,438 m elevation and liklihood of early snowfall, most visitor services on the North Rim are only available during a short season that usually lasts from May 15 through October 15 of each year. Only 10% of travelers visit the North Rim. The North Rim is located on the Utah side of the Canyon. The nearest towns to the park's North Rim village are Fredonia, Arizona, and Kanab, Utah. There is no airport or rail service to the park. (that means that the North Rim village may only be reached by road) Because the North Rim has a shorter season, Campground Reservations are strongly Recommended.",
